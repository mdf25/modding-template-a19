# PATCH SCRIPTS
This folder should only be used if you are using DMT. If not, you can safely remove it.

Sometimes you may need to modify the code of the assembly directly in order to add functionality not available via Harmony patching.

If so, all patch scripts should go here. They must implement IPatcherMod to work correctly.
