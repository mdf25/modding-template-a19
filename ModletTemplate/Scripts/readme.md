# SCRIPTS
This folder should only be used if you are using DMT. If not, you can safely remove it.

Any scripts you make that add new functionality should go in this folder. You can create as many sub folders as you want inside here and all scripts will be found.

Example scripts that you'd use here:
- Extending a block class or creating a new one
- Making a new buff type
- Making a new item action
- Helper methods for other scripts
